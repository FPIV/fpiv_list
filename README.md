# üéØ `fpiv_list`: The Core Algorithm Arsenal

A high-performance, production-ready library of list-based algorithms, forged by **FPIV**. This is the foundational component of our digital arsenal, providing the essential, battle-tested tools for achieving algorithmic supremacy in Dart.

---
## Why `fpiv_list`?

This library was built not just to provide functions, but to provide a competitive edge.

* **‚öîÔ∏è Comprehensive Arsenal:** An extensive collection of over 40 algorithms, covering everything from fundamental sorting and searching to highly specialized and advanced list manipulation techniques.
* **üöÄ Performance-Driven:** Every algorithm is implemented with a focus on efficiency. Our detailed benchmarks demonstrate superior performance, allowing you to build fast and responsive applications.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Production-Ready & Robust:** With over 140+ unit tests, thorough documentation, and robust error handling for edge cases, `fpiv_list` is built for reliable use in production environments.
* **üß¨ Modern & Type-Safe:** Written in modern Dart, leveraging generics (`<T extends Comparable<T>>`) to provide a clean, type-safe, and predictable API.

## Algorithms Included

This library is a complete toolkit for list manipulation, including (but not limited to):

* **Advanced & Basic Sorting:**
    * Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Comb Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, and **over 20 more** powerful sorting algorithms.
* **Efficient Searching:**
    * Binary Search (for sorted lists), Linear Search.
* **Subarray & Subsequence Problems:**
    * Kadane's Algorithm, Max Product Subarray, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Two Sum, and more.
* **Core List Utilities:**
    * Find Max/Min, Reverse, Rotate, Find Duplicates, Remove Duplicates, Prefix Sum, and more.

## Installation


Add `fpiv_list` to your `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fpiv_list: ^0.1.0 # Check pub.dev for the latest version
```

Then, import the library in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:fpiv_list/fpiv_list.dart';
```

## Quick Start
```dart
import 'package:fpiv_list/fpiv_list.dart';

void main() {
  var numbers = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5];
  print('Original List: $numbers');

  // Use a high-performance sort from the arsenal
  quickSort(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1);
  print('Sorted with Quick Sort: $numbers');

  // Find an element efficiently
  final index = binarySearch(numbers, 8);
  print('Found 8 at index: $index'); // Output: Found 8 at index: 2
}
```
